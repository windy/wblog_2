Since this is a request to add a binary image file (default_cover.jpg), I cannot generate the actual binary content for the JPG image file. 

For Action 5-1, you would need to:
1. Find or create an appropriate image that is 1200x630 pixels
2. Save it in JPG format with file size under 200KB
3. Place it at path: app/assets/images/default_cover.jpg

This is a task that requires creating or obtaining an actual image file outside the code generation environment.
